# Hands-On Natural Language Processing with Pytorch [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Natural Language Processing with Pytorch [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-natural-language-processing-pytorch-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789133974), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The main goal of this course is to train you to perform complex NLP tasks and build intelligent language applications using Deep Learning with PyTorch.
You will build two complete real-world NLP applications throughout the course. The first application is a Sentiment Analyzer that analyzes data to determine whether a review is positive or negative towards a particular movie. You will then create an advanced Neural Translation Machine that is a speech translation engine, using Sequence to Sequence models with the speed and flexibility of PyTorch to translate given text into different languages.
By the end of the course, you will have the skills to build your own real-world NLP models using PyTorch's Deep Learning capabilities.
